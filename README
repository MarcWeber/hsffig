This is a source distribution of HSFFIG: yet another FFI binding
autogeneration utility, version 1.0

The utility is built on the simple principle: given a C include
file (.h) for a library, generate a Haskell module (or a collection 
of modules) containing FFI bindings for the library. No configuration files,
no manually written wrappers, nothing else. Maximum, a single include
file needs to be written manually, containing only few #include directives.

It is assumed that GNU C compiler is used. The utility has not been tested
with compilers from other vendors. Also the utility is significantly
biased towards GHC as the Haskell compiler to use, and although it may work
with Hugs as well, this has not been tested yet.

For installation instructions, please read the file INSTALL.

For documentation, please refer to http://haskell.org/hawiki/HsffigTutorial.

For possible directions of HSFFIG improvements, please read the file TODO.

For any questions, concerns, and other related matters don't hesitate to contact
