This file contains installation instructions for the source distribution
of HSFFIG Version 1.0.

This distribution comes with it own Cabal setup program, so it is not
necessary to have Cabal installed to install HSFFIG. Even more, it is 
preferred to use the `cabal-setup' program included with this distribution
rather than the "standard" Cabal setup program.

- After unpacking the tarball, go to the root directory of the distibution
and run `make'. Among other things, this builds the Cabal setup executable
furter referred to as `./cabal-setup'

- Run ./cabal-setup configure. Alex is required to compile HSFFIG, so it 
is necessary to provide path to Alex executable (the `--with-alex=' option
of ./cabal-setup configure).

- Run ./cabal-setup build. This builds the HSFFIG library, and all executables.

- Run ./cabal-setup install. This install the library and the executables,
and registers the package with GHC.

At this point, HSFFIG is ready to use.
