This file contains installation instructions for the source distribution
of HSFFIG Version 1.1. It has been adjusted to compile with GHC 6.4.1.
For GHC 6.2.2 please use HSFFIG Version 1.0

- After unpacking the tarball, go to the root directory of the distibution
and run `make'. This compiles the hsc2hs template code included with every
.hsc file generated into a Haskell module.

- Run runghc Setup.hs configure. Alex is required to compile HSFFIG, so it 
is necessary to provide path to Alex executable (the `--with-alex=' option
of configure).

- Run runghc Setup.hs build. This builds the HSFFIG library, and all executables.

- Run runghc Setup.hs install. This installs the library and the executables,
and registers the package with GHC.

At this point, HSFFIG is ready to use.

NOTE. It was observed that the Cabal version packaged with GHC 6.4.1 does not
work well when installing executables. Cabal Version 1.1.3 is OK.
